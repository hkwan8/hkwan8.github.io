                        <p>
                            In the previous post, we saw that the increased use of aesthetics in human-computer
                            interactions. But do aesthetics have a functional use besides a better appearance? Can
                            aesthetics increase the usability of a product?
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In a study done in 2011, Lavie and Tractinsky did a study to explore the relationship
                            between aesthetics and usability. They conducted a couple of experiments to determine if
                            aesthetics affected the usability of an in-vehicle navigation display. Since a navigation
                            display is highly functional, the usability of the device is important. After three separate
                            studies, they concluded that a display with a higher aesthetics score correlated with a
                            higher usability score, and less clutter increased usability.
                        </p>

                                It may also be that the high usability of the minimal detail maps affected the perceived
                                aesthetics of the maps, and irrelevant information presented on maps made the maps
                                appear less aesthetic.

                        <p>
                            However, because aesthetics and usability can be subjective, further papers have tried to
                            explore the relationship between them in a more objective way. Tuch et al. wrote a paper
                            asking the question “Is beauty really usable?” The authors’ tried to separate
                            interface-aesthetics from interface-usability as much as possible to produce more objective
                            results. In doing several experiments, the authors’ concluded that the users’ “hedonic
                            quality identification” actually depended less on the perceived aesthetics, but more on
                            perceived usability. This indicated a stronger relationship between the users’ value of
                            usability over aesthetics.

                        <p>
                            The difficult aspect in the relationship between aesthetics and usability is not only its
                            subjectivity, but also its development over time. As computer screens have gotten more
                            pixels and smartphones have become more popular, aesthetics have changed over the last
                            couple of decades. Some of these studies, completed in the last decade, seem outdated based
                            on its user interfaces and designs. The discrepancy between previous studies and the current
                            state of application aesthetics could be a threat to the validity since the studies do not
                            represent the aesthetics we are used to today. Researchers have tried to explore this
                            difficulty, but between Lavie and Tractinsky and Tuch et al., the relationship between
                            aesthetics and usability is not clearly defined. In fact, as further studies have shown,
                            this relationship varies even more in different cultural contexts. In 2016, Oyibo and
                            Vassileva researched the relationship between aesthetics, usability, and credibility in
                            different cultures. They studied between two groups, one Canadian group, and one Nigerian
                            group. They acknowledged the varying perspectives on the relationship between aesthetics and
                            usability, but in their study they found that, overall, aesthetics has an affect on
                            usability, but to what a degree depends on the culture. This study introduces another aspect
                            on the effect of aesthetics. Oyibo and Vassileva looked how aesthetics and usability
                            affected credibility, both generally and in a cultural context. Similarly to aesthetics and
                            usability, there is an overall correlation between better aesthetics and greater
                            credibility, but culturally, the effect of aesthetics on credibility influenced the Canadian
                            group more than the Nigerian group.

                            There are other relationships that HCI researchers have studied, one of these being the
                            relationship between aesthetics and credibility. We will explore this briefly in the next
                            post.

                        <h2>Side Note on Aesthetic Studies</h2>

                        <p>
                            The difficult aspect in the relationship between aesthetics and usability is not only its
                            subjectivity, but also its development over time. As computer screens have gotten more
                            pixels and smartphones have become more popular, aesthetics have changed over the last
                            couple of decades. Some of these studies, completed in the last decade, seem outdated based
                            on its user interfaces and designs. The discrepancy between previous studies and the current
                            state of application aesthetics could be a threat to the validity since the studies do not
                            represent the aesthetics we are used to today. Researchers focus on the aesthetics of their
                            time, but even a couple years changes the aesthetics that people use daily.

                            Here are a couple pictures from the studies mentioned earlier. it is evident that many of
                            these layouts are outdated.

                        <p>
                            I did find some studies that were very specific that were more objective. One group of
                            researchers, Fan, Hu, Zhao and Zhang, from Beijing, China studied the ideal size of two
                            different touch buttons, a round button and a rounded corner button, on a mobile phone. They
                            had thirty participants and they tested different size buttons for each type of button, and
                            recorded reaction times and error rates by having participants correctly type numbers
                            displayed to them. They also had participants rate their satisfaction on a scale from one to
                            five. From these tests, they found that the average reaction time and error rate decreased
                            with the increasing size of the button. They recommend that the best sizes for a round
                            button are between 13 and 19mm and the best sizes for a rounded corner button are between 11
                            and 19mm. This kind of study helps quantify components of the aesthetics. However, this has
                            limitations as well. There are many different kinds of components that make a user
                            interface, and testing them all would require many studies. At the same time, this does not
                            directly test the relationship between aesthetics and usability, but determines the
                            aesthetics through testing.
