                            The most popular companies have design guidelines for developers to follow to make their
                            applications consistent in the application store. The existence of these guidelines
                            demonstrate the importance of aesthetics to companies like Apple, Google, and even
                            Microsoft. They have elaborate, user-friendly, and impressively designed websites to reflect
                            the quality they expect in developers to match their platform.
                        </p>

                        <h2>A Comparison of Apple and Google Design Guidelines</h2>

                        <p>
                            Both Apple and Google have online design guidelines. Though the applications made for these
                            companies are on different platforms, the design guidelines share many similarities.
                        </p>

                        <h3>The Website</h3>

                        <p>
                            Apple named their guidelines the <a
                                href="https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/">Human Interface
                                Guidelines</a>. Outlined are the rules the
                            Apple uses for its own products that they share with developers. One of Apple’s design
                            principles is aesthetic integrity, seeming to agree that aesthetics do affect usability.
                        </p>

                                Aesthetic integrity represents how well an app’s appearance and behavior integrate with
                                its function. For example, an app that helps people perform a serious task can keep them
                                focused by using subtle, unobtrusive graphics, standard controls, and predictable
                                behaviors.

                        <p>
                            There are different categories, such as, User Interaction, Visual Design and specific
                            functional components like Views and Controls.
                        </p>

                        <p>Google has guidelines named <a href="https://material.io/">Material Design</a>. One of
                            Material Design’s main principles is the
                            thought that “Material is the metaphor”.</p>

                                Material Design is inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they
                                reflect light and cast shadows. Material surfaces reimagine the mediums of paper and
                                ink.

                        <p>
                            In their principles, they claim that Material Design is “guided by print design methods” to
                            make its interface familiar to users. There are two main sections, one tab for design, such
                            as color, typography and layout, and another tab for components like Buttons, Menus and Text
                            fields. Apple has different design guidelines for each of their systems, like macOS and iOS,
                            while Google has general design guidelines.

                        <h3>Recommendations</h3>

                        <p>
                            Both guidelines make recommendations in each section, even displaying side-by-side
                            comparisons for do’s and don’t’s, as well as general recommendations for each topic. For
                            example, here are some screenshots of both Apple’s and Google’s recommendation for margins.

                        <h3>Why Design Guidelines?
                        </h3>

                        <p>Apple and Google are not the only companies with design guidelines. Microsoft has design
                            guidelines named <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/">Fluent Design</a>,
                            Samsung has design guidelines by the name <a href="https://developer.samsung.com/one-ui">One
                                UI</a>, and even
                            Amazon has design guidelines for the <a
                                href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/fire-tv/design-and-user-experience-guidelines.html">Amazon
                                Fire TV</a>. The main reason for these guidelines is
                            to create a unified experience for users on the specific platform. These guidelines have
                            become necessary because many developers can create applications and put them in any
                            application store. </p>

                                Due to the widespread diffusion of mobile devices, consumers expect user-friendly and
                                well-designed mobile applications from service providers in various industries.
                            </p>
                            <cite>Hoehle and Venkatesh</cite>
                        </blockquote>

                        <p>
                            Hartmut Hoehle studied how effect following design guidelines would impact both “continued
                            intention to use” and “mobile application loyalty” with Apple and Microsoft guidelines.
                            Hoehle, Aljafari, and Venkatesh conducted a study on Microsoft guidelines by evaluating ten
                            constructs: aesthetic graphics, color, control obviousness, entry point, fingertip-size
                            controls, font, gestalt, hierarchy, subtle animation and transition. They conducted a survey
                            with 550 German consumers and found that these constructs based on Microsoft guidelines did
                            lead users to continue to use the application and brand loyalty. Hoehle and Venkatesh proved
                            the same with Apple’s guidelines, but using 19 constructs from the guidelines and on 1,200
                            U.S. consumers. These studies demonstrate the value of design guidelines. There is some
                            evidence that the constructs contained in company design guidelines do positively impact the
                            consumer and is economically beneficial since it leads to continued use and brand loyalty.
                            As they indicated in the paper, consumers now have certain expectations from mobile
                            applications, and one way to meet those expectations is to use a design similar to platforms
                            they are using.
                        </p>

                        <p>Users are more likely to use something that is familiar to them, such as a design similar to
                            the operating system they have. This is supported by a study done in 2019 by Bhandari,
                            Chang, and Neben, “Understanding the impact of perceived visual aesthetics on user
                            evaluations: An emotional perspective”. They manipulated the classical and expressive
                            aesthetics of a mobile app to assess which elicited a stronger emotional response, which was
                            measured in valence, how positive the experience was for the user, and arousal, the
                            “activation of particular emotions”. Then, they used these metrics to determine how it
                            affected the participant’s judgement of the application.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These researchers emphasize the importance of mobile application aesthetics:

                                with. In this light, this study was able to show a process-oriented approach to
                                understand what could be the potential reasoning behind users choosing certain apps
                                compared to other apps based on aesthetic evaluation and “affective” responses.

                            This study demonstrated the importance of emotions in a user’s decision-making. These
                            emotions are more effected by classical aesthetics than expressive aesthetics. By using
                            these design guidelines, developers increase the chance that the users will make positive
                            decisions in considering the application. And as time has shown, mobile phones have become
                            the norm, and designing the interfaces properly will benefit both the developer and the
                            user.
