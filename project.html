                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p class="lead drop-cap">
                            In today’s current consumer technology market, there are multitudes of applications that
                            rely on user-gathered data in order to drive the experiences of their app. For Cal Poly
                            start up company Trees, the success of their goal-achievement mobile application relies on
                            gathering user data like personality, geographic, and demographic data to create
                            personally-tailored action plans for those seeking to achieve a goal. Due to the sensitive
                            nature of the data being collected, Trees strive to be as transparent as possible to its
                            users about the data the app gathers from them. The goal of this project is to gather data
                            about students’ opinions about data collection and whether data transparency affects their
                            perceptions of an app and to create a prototype for the onboarding process of the Trees app.
                            Our design aims to inform users of the purpose of the app while being upfront about data
                            collection practices and, ultimately, we hope to create an interface that users feel secure
                            and comfortable using.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Overview</h2>
                        <p>A Cal Poly local incubator company is planning to build Trees, a goal-achievement app that
                            aims to generate personally-curated action plans to help users achieve a goal in a way that
                            suits each user. It plans to create these action plans by taking effective user-generated
                            goal-achievement plans and gathering users’ personality, demographic, geographic, and habit
                            data, and incorporating them into a machine learning algorithm that takes these features and
                            generates action plan steps for users. This data will be gathered from questionnaires that
                            users fill out through the app. Generic goal plans often don’t consider variables and
                            availability of resources that can limit one’s ability to accomplish said goal, but by
                            accounting for these factors, Trees hopes that more people will be successful in achieving
                            their goals. </p>

                            <figcaption>A diagram representing how the Trees app works</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            One of the major potential concerns about this app is its usage of user data. Many apps
                            today gather data from users like location, screen time, visited websites, etc. in order to
                            tailor advertisements and other experiences to the user’s interests, but many users are not
                            actually aware of the amount of data that is being gathered. The Trees company is mindful of
                            the fact that the app will require the collection of sensitive user data for the app to
                            recommend action plans properly. Trees hopes to proactively alleviate user concerns about
                            data abuse by being transparent and upfront about what data is being collected by the app.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Initial discussions with the Trees team determined that one way they plan to uphold data
                            transparency is to provide a data dashboard feature within the app. On this page, users
                            would be able to view what data the app has collected along with justifications as to why
                            the collected data is needed by the app and how that information is used. This page would
                            also allow users to edit or delete certain types of collected data. The goal of this
                            dashboard is to reassure users that the Trees application is only collecting necessary data
                            and using it responsibly, hopefully increasing user trust.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            However, during the early stages of our design process, the question of whether users would
                            even use the data dashboard came up. Do users care enough about data collection that they
                            would use the data dashboard feature provided? These concerns caused a shift of focus for
                            this project from designing an interface for controlling data collection to designing an
                            onboarding experience for the Trees app that informs users of their data collection means.
                            In addition, through this project, we hope to get a better understanding of users’ opinions
                            on data collection and whether a clear data transparency policy affects their perception and
                            trust in an app. In the end, we aim to create a design that upholds Trees’ goal of data
                            transparency.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Goal-setting is an activity that people of all demographics and ages can partake in, thus
                            the target audience for this app is very broad. For this project, we are focusing on one of
                            the major intended user bases for this app: students. Example goals that this app could help
                            students achieve include earning better grades, becoming more sociable, or learning a new
                            hobby.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Background and Related Work</h2>
                        <p>
                            Prior to this project, Trees has created a number of UI designs for the primary
                            functionalities of the app, ranging from lower fidelity wireframes to higher fidelity
                            prototypes with interactive components. However, there is presently no mockup or wireframe
                            for the onboarding process for a new user. This provides an opportunity to explore methods
                            on how to be transparent about data collection during the introductory phase of an app. To
                            maintain Trees’ goal of data transparency, it is key to design an interface where this
                            information is easily communicated to the user.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            While there are companies who are transparent about their data collection practices, <a

                                prefer to keep consumers in the dark, choose control over sharing, and ask for
                                forgiveness rather than permission</a>. The companies that are considered transparent
                            traditionally explain the nuances of their data collection practices in a <a

                                policy page</a>. For example, Google has <a
                                href=”https://safety.google/privacy/data/”>several web pages</a> explaining the usage of
                            user data across their services, and offers <a
                                href=”https://safety.google/privacy/privacy-controls/”>visual tutorials</a> on how to
                            access privacy controls within their suite of applications.

                        <p>
                            UI/UX is a subsection of Human-Computer Interaction that focuses on the interfaces and
                            experiences of computational devices. Analyzing and comparing the different amounts and
                            kinds of interactions across varying designs will help determine pain points, areas with
                            heavy mental load, and other aspects that shape the experience that users have with such a
                            device. It’s important to understand how users interact with a product and interface, as
                            that can determine the retention of regular users and traffic, which drive the fiscal and
                            social success of an application. In particular, the onboarding experience is one of the
                            most important, as it can influence whether a user wants to continue using an app.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Furthermore, transparency about data collection is a relatively new topic in UI/UX, since
                            this phenomenon has rapidly expanded in recent years due to advances in mobile technology
                            and data collection practices. Currently, many companies <a
                                href=”https://hbr.org/2015/05/customer-data-designing-for-transparency-and-trust”>prefer
                                not being transparent</a> to their users about their data collection. Exploring how to
                            display such complex information and how it affects user perceptions and attitudes can
                            contribute towards the push to get more companies to be more honest to users about this
                            topic.
                        </p>
                        <h2>Experimental Design</h2>

                        <p>
                            Since our project relies on gathering user feedback and data about their stances on certain
                            topics, we created a design for our user testing. First, we created our prototype using
                            Figma, due to its collaboration support and its ability to project the prototype to a mobile
                            device. When conducting user tests, users will interact with the prototype through a mobile
                            device.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            First, we need to get an initial impression of their experience and beliefs about data
                            privacy. This will help determine if a typical user is concerned about data collection, and
                            if transparent policies will affect their perception of an application. These questions lend
                            to more open-ended responses.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some questions that intend to gather user information about this include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Are you aware of what data apps are collecting on you? What do you know about the
                                    collection of data in social media and technology?</li>
                                <li>How much do you care about apps taking your data?</li>
                                <li>Do you know what data they collect? What do they use it for?</li>
                                <li>How much would you pay (Amazon, Google, etc) to not collect and sell your data?</li>
                                <li>How would you feel if apps gave you the ability to easily control the data you’re
                                    giving to the app? Any particular feelings about this?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As desired by our stakeholder, the Trees company, we also asked questions about how users
                            like to achieve goals. This will give us an understanding of how likely users would use an
                            app like Trees, which is valuable information for our stakeholders.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Some questions that intend to gather user information about this include:
                            <ul>
                                <li>How do you usually teach yourself something/where do you go to learn skills?</li>
                                <li>Did you have any New Year’s resolutions? How are they going? What did you do to
                                    carry them out?</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Users will interact with our Figma prototype with two interviewers. One interviewer will
                            focus on taking notes using a Google form. The other will focus on asking questions. We will
                            encourage the user to comment on their thought process when using the app and ask them to
                            discuss any pain points or frustrations.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Lastly, the interview will conclude by asking users to complete a user survey to help
                            generate more quantifiable data. The questions in this survey would be similar to the
                            questions above, but modified to receive a quantitative answer, by adding “on a scale from 1
                            to 10…”. In addition, the survey will also ask about users’ comprehension about the Trees
                            app by asking them to briefly explain what Trees does, and ask about their college year and
                            major.
                        </p>

                        <p>Survey questions include:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Can you briefly explain, in your own words, what the app, Trees, is about and what it
                                does?</li>
                            <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, how helpful do you think action plans would be to you with
                                achieving goals?</li>
                            <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, how likely would you use an app like Trees?</li>
                            <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, how pleasant was the on-boarding process for the Trees app?
                            </li>
                            <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, how simple was the navigation during the on-boarding process
                                for the Trees app?</li>
                            <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, how much do you care about data privacy, data collection, and
                                data transparency in technology, social media, and other computational devices?</li>
                            <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, if an app provided a feature that will allow you to control
                                your data / prevent certain data from being used by an app, how likely would you use
                                this feature?</li>
                            <li>On a scale from 1 to 10, how comfortable would you be with allowing an app like Trees to
                                use your data?</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>First Prototype</h2>
                        <p>
                            For our first iteration, we created a high fidelity prototype of the onboarding process for
                            the Trees mobile application. For our first round of user testing, users will interact with
                            this prototype from a mobile device by clicking buttons and other elements on these screens.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The prototype offers a quick introduction to the app and immediately gets users to start
                            creating action plans for their goals. Following the three introduction screens, users can
                            select a goal they want to achieve.
                        </p>

                        </figure>

                        <p>
                            From the third screen (titled Onboarding 2 in the image above), users have the option of
                            clicking the “demographic”, “geographic”, and “personality” links, that will bring up pop up
                            windows that explain how this data is used by Trees. These pop up screens aim to achieve
                            Trees’ goal of data transparency by clearly and concisely explaining what users’ data will
                            be used for.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Lastly, onboarding proceeds by having users go through and answer a quick sample
                            questionnaire for generating action plans and select action plans. This portion incorporates
                            many existing elements and designs that have already been designed for the Trees app.

                        <h2>Implementation</h2>
                        <p> For our user tests, we outlined two questionnaires in Google Forms, one for the interviewer
                            to fill out during the test, and one for the interviewee to fill out at the end of the user
                            test. These Google Forms contain the questions discussed in our experimental design. In the
                            beginning of our user testing process, we ran two practice tests with a rough draft of the
                            questionnaires. These initial user tests helped us realize any format adjustments and
                            question improvements that needed to be improved. We also made some minor adjustments for
                            the forms for interviewers, like increasing the granularity of the text boxes for inputting
                            answers to questions. We also updated the general questions we ask users, for example, we
                            shortened the number of questions focusing on their knowledge on data collection, in order
                            to expedite the over interview process. In this process, we managed to conduct 5 full formal
                            user tests and interviews, and an additional 2 shorter user tests, totaling in 7 completed
                            user testing sessions.
                        </p>
                        <h2>User Feedback</h2>
                        <p>We conducted interviews with seven people. Five of those people filled out our final survey.
                            The following graphs show the demographics of our users. To protect the confidentiality of
                            our participants, we only collected their year and their major.</p>

                        <p>The participants had the following majors: Graphic Communication, Kinesiology, Business,
                            Materials Engineering, and Economics.</p>

                        <img src="images/project/survey_year.png" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">

                        <p>The following graphs display the responses to each of the questions that asked for a rating
                            between 1 and 10. These two questions asked the user about the usage of the app itself. We
                            found that while users found action plans might be helpful in achieving goals, most of the
                            users would likely not use the Trees app. This suggests that the prototype may be lacking in
                            qualities that can retain and attract users.</p>

                        <img src="images/project/survey_action_plans.png" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"
                            alt="">

                            alt="">

                        <p>The user was then asked two questions related to the UI of the app. The responses were mostly
                            positive, and signified that our prototype successfully conducted a pleasant and usable
                            experience.</p>

                        <img src="images/project/survey_onboarding.png" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"
                            alt="">

                            alt="">

                        <p>The last three questions measured how much users cared about data transparency.</p>

                        <p>One interesting result was that users did not care much about data transparency and privacy,
                            but when asked if they would use a feature that would allow them to control their privacy,
                            the majority of users said they would use such a feature. This indicates that there is a
                            desire for a feature to control data being collected.</p>

                        <img src="images/project/survey_data_privacy.png" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"
                            alt="">

                        <img src="images/project/survey_feature.png" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px" alt="">

                        <img src="images/project/survey_comfortable.png" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"
                            alt="">

                        <p>Overall, the response was that users would trust Trees with their data. This suggests that
                            the prototype was successful in evoking trust from users.</p>

                        <p>Finally, for the responses to the free response survey question “Can you briefly explain, in
                            your own words, what the app, Trees, is about and what it does?,” all were able to correctly
                            identify that Trees was an application that aids in goal achievement and management. This
                            indicates that our first prototype was successful in introducing the app’s purpose to users.
                            However, for that same question, only 40% of the responses mention anything relating to
                            using user data to generate action plans (i.e. mentioning personality, demographics, etc),
                            suggesting that information regarding data collection wasn’t presented well in our
                            prototype.
                        </p>

                        <p>The phenomena above is likely due to one of the major issues we found in our user testing: no
                            one selected the links on the third page of the onboarding process. These are the links that
                            bring up pop up boxes about information on how Trees use users’ demographic, personality,
                            and geographic data. This is problematic because it means that the app fails to inform users
                            about its data collection practices, thus it is not upholding Trees’ data transparency
                            goals.</p>

                        <p>To supplement our formal first round of user testing, we conducted one round of A/B testing
                            during our mid-quarter presentation. We showed three versions of a screen, and asked people
                            in passing to draw a tally on the screen that would encourage them to click on the links.
                            The votes were unanimous for the first option: selecting a screen that highlighted the
                            options through a lightbox overlay.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/project/ab_test_screens.png" sizes="(max-width: 2000px) 100vw, 2000px"
                                alt="">
                            <figcaption>Variations on the third screen that we used for AB testing</figcaption>
                        </figure>

                        <p>Another frustration that users had during user testing was the inability to click every
                            element on the prototype. Because our prototype was designed in Figma, it was not fully
                            functional, and users struggled with broken links, and animations that did not fully
                            simulate the end-product. This is just a consequence of the nature of prototypes/mockups,
                            and the only way to improve this is to add more screens and functionality to our prototypes.
                        </p>

                        <p>Overall, users reacted positively with the first prototype, and found the onboarding process
                            to be pleasant. However, several users expressed that they will likely not use an app like
                            Trees. They did have suggestions on how to improve the app in a way that could help them
                            want to use the app more often. One particular concern that a user had was that, visually,
                            Trees did not immediately present itself as a goal achievement app from the very first
                            screen--users wanted to know what the app is about from the very first screen. Several users
                            suggested adding animations/graphics on the first page to help with this. Another user also
                            suggested adding user “success stories” to make the action plan and app more credible and
                            reliable. A user also stated that implementing to-do lists or integration with Cal Poly
                            study sessions and services would get him to use the app more. A few also noted that the
                            onboarding process overall felt a bit long, especially with the inclusion of a full length
                            questionnaire.</p>
                        <h2>Second Prototype</h2>
                        <p>Following the results of our user testing, we iterated and improved upon our first prototype
                            based on user feedback.</p>

                        <p>First, we added a tree graphic in the welcome page. In doing so, there is more variety in the
                            page, and provides something for users to associate the Trees app with. The current graphic
                            is an open-source placeholder and would ideally be replaced by a proper logo for Trees.
                            Then, we added a light box overlay to indicate that the “demographic”, “geographic”, and
                            “personality” text are clickable—a direct result of the feedback we got from our AB test.
                            With this, we hope that more users would be inclined to click the text and learn more about
                            how Trees use their data.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, we added a user testimony section where users select a goal they want to achieve.
                            This section would contain real users’ testimonies explaining how the action plan they
                            received helped them successfully achieve the goal that the user selected. By adding this,
                            we hope that users feel that the app is more personable, relatable, and credible, which
                            could inspire users to use the app more frequently.</p>

                        <figure>

                        </figure>

                        <p>We also took the user feedback, particularly the feedback on the app’s credibility and the
                            onboarding process’s length and ability to present what the app is about on the first
                            screen, to create an alternate version of the welcome screen. In this take, the very first
                            screen includes a description of what Trees does, as well as a punchy app subtitle and
                            images of a person performing an action/goal that can be achieved through this app. There
                            are four description screens in total, in which users navigate through by sliding, but
                            sliding to the other description screens are optional--users can simply tap “Get Started”
                            and immediately go to the goal selection screen.</p>

                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/project/proposed_welcome_screens.png"

                        </figure>

                        <p>This design offers a more streamlined onboarding process as users no longer have to go
                            through all of the information screens in the first prototype. Furthermore, adding images of
                            real people and a memorable catchphrase makes the app appear more credible, personable, and
                            relatable. The downside is that, because the description screens are now optional to look
                            through, users are likely not going to read the other screens, including information about
                            data collection. Also, because of the streamlined nature of this version, there is less room
                            to present information about how user data is used. This version essentially sacrifices
                            Trees’ goal of being upfront about data collection and usage for retaining and attracting
                            users.</p>
                        <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                        <p>Coming into this project, we were excited to make a user interface that had real-world
                            applications, especially in the world of data transparency. It was helpful to have meetings
                            roughly once a week with our stakeholder to lay down requirements and discuss our prototype.
                        </p>

                        <p>One valuable experience we gained from this project was navigating the intricacies of working
                            with an external stakeholder. Balancing company needs and expectations with our academic
                            goals was an interesting challenge. In this process, we discovered the importance of
                            defining requirements before prototyping and performing experimental design to plan user
                            tests that gather the data we are seeking for. Knowing these items, we were able to design
                            specific features to meet the needs of the company and the user. We also learned about the
                            significance of stakeholders’ intellectual property, and how to properly incorporate it into
                            our designs while preserving its confidentiality.</p>

                        <p>In regards to data transparency, it was interesting to see that many of the college-aged
                            students who participated in our user testing didn’t care too much about data transparency,
                            but would control what data they share when presented. We think this phenomena is a result
                            of companies’ current approach of being discreet about their data collection. Because people
                            aren’t actively thinking about responsible data collection in their experiences with apps,
                            it’s not something they end up caring about.</p>

                        <p>Lastly, this project highlighted the significance of understanding the audience of the
                            product and designing with the audience in mind. When we had initially planned to design the
                            data control interface, we weren’t sure if users would actually use a feature like this. But
                            after going through this project—designing the onboarding and asking about users’
                            impressions on data transparency—we were able to gather some desire for this functionality.
                        </p>

                        <p>For the future, we hope that our work will help Trees make informed design decisions and that
                            our prototype can serve as helpful foundations leading to their final application design.
                            The next step would be to conduct more user testing and iterate upon our onboarding
                            interface more, as well as design the data dashboard feature.</p>
